# clean_architecture_tdd

A Flutter project made by following the clean architecture and tdd principles.

This project is the implementation of the app created in this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4iYGE_khpXRdJkJEp9WOech), provided by Reso Coder. 

Even though the tutorial is a bit outdated (e.g. some packages did not support null safety), this implementation was made using the latest verions of the necessary packages, also changing the ones which didn't support null safety until now.
